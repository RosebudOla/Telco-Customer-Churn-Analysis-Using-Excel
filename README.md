# Project Name: Telco Customer Churn Analysis
----
# Problem Statement:Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecommunications industry, affecting revenue and customer retention strategies. This analysis aims to identify key factors influencing customer churn, providing insights to help mitigate it and enhance customer satisfaction.
----
# Data Sourcing:
The dataset was collected from a telecommunications company and consists of customer details, including demographics, contract types, internet services, payment methods, and churn status.
----
# Data Cleaning and Transformation:
The dataset was loaded into Power BI for cleaning and transformation.
Null values and duplicate records were checked, but none were found.
Data types were validated to ensure consistency for accurate analysis.
The cleaned dataset was then applied for visualization and further insights.
----
# Data Visualization:
Power BI was used to create an interactive dashboard to analyze churn trends and influencing factors. Key metrics such as total customers, churn rate, total revenue, and customer segmentation were visualized using bar charts, filters, and KPIs.
